1. synonyms -> Isomorphic, Universal, SSR
    -> these are all different words meaning the exact same thing.

2. SSR
    -> client rendering -> server sends data to client and client renders HTML.
    -> server rendering -> server renders HTML and send this HTML to client.
    -> SSR: Blending client side and server side: Fetch data on the server and render finished pages.

3. Benefits of SSR:
    -> Faster load times
        If we are running pretty large application or that will grow very large,
        rendering on server will have performance improvements in terms of response time of your App.
        consider this fact, the browser on which your application renders the application is 
        impacted by the machine it runs on. Therefore, if people are looking at your application
        on older hardware such as an old phone laptop they will see a difference in performance
        to those running your hardware. however, by rendering the application in the server
        you control the performance of render.
    -> Improved SEO
        Additionally if you are concerned if your site or application gets found in the
        top results of google that might be the second benefit of rendering an application
        on the server.
        JavaScript doesn't play well with search engines and unfortunately when google for instance
        sends it bots to index your pages and it sees it javascript not HTML
        Over the past few years the situation has improved but you are better positioned to be 
        indexed properly if what that bot sees is HTML.


4. Next.js -> A fullstack framework for reactjs.

5. useHistory hook exposed by "react-router-dom" to route programmatically.
    -> const history = useHistory();
    -> history.push("/path"); or history.replace("/path");

6. Next.js routing
    -> From code based to file based
    -> create react component files and let nextjs infer the routes from the folder structure.
    -> In file based routing we don't need extra boilerplate like <switch><Route></Route</switch>.

7. <Link> component prefetches the data as soon as we hover over on it.

8. _app.js is a root component under which different page component renders in.

9. Next.js will not just return pre-rendered page but also the js code that belongs to it,
    -> and it will do something called hydrate with react code once loaded 
    -> and that code will take over that pre-rendered page and let react do its job.
    -> We sent back pre-rendered page initally so that all the core content was right there from the start
    -> this pre-rendering only affects the initial load

10. two forms of pre-rendering 
    -> static generation -> All the pages are pre-generated in advance during build time before you deploy it.
        -> data in pages are prepared during build time.
        -> because pages are created during build time they can be cached by server/CDN.
        -> after the pages are served they are still hydrated with you react app.
        -> so we have a regular react app in the end. 
        -> only difference is that the pages sent to the client are not empty initally but pre-populated.
        -> how do we tell nextjs which data is needed to pre-generated the page?
        -> you can export a function called `async function getStaticProps(context)` that we can export from our page components(not from other react components).
        -> code inside `getStaticProps` will only run on server side and not on client and also does not have access to client API's(window etc).
        -> when we export this function nextjs will call this function on your behalf when it pre-generates the page.
        -> and this function also singals to nextjs that this is a page that should be pre-generated.
        -> nextjs will first execute this function and in the second step execute the functional component.
        -> it should return an object with props key({props: {}}).
    -> server side rendering -> pages are created just in time after deployment after request reaches the server.

11. Incremental static generation 
    -> built-in nextjs feature
    -> it means that you don't just generate your page statically once at build time
    -> but that is continusally updated even after deployment without you reployment.
    -> so you pre-generate a page but then you can also tell nextjs that the given page should
    -> be re-generated again for every incoming request for every X seconds
    -> ex- if new request comes and X seconds already passed from the last request re-gennerate the page.
    -> i.e 'serve old page if re-generation is not needed yet' or 'Generate Store and serve new page otherwise'

12. Pre-Generated paths (routes)
    -> To Pre-render dynamic pages([id].js etc) nextjs need to know which [id] values will be available
    -> Multiple concrete [id] page instances(ex: id=1, id=2 etc.) are pre-generated
    -> we do inform nextjs about this by using another function `async function getStaticPaths()`
    -> json data is pre-fetched by nextjs when we visit the root page and even before we hover over the links.

13. fallback: true in getStaticPaths return obj.
    ->fallback key can help if we have lot of pages which wouldn't need pre-generating
    ->for ex if we are creating blog website and we have millions of articles but very 
    ->few articles are frequently read so pre-rendering all the blogs is waste of resources
    ->when we set fallback: true we tell nextjs that even pages that are not listed here
    ->can be valid values that should be loaded when they are visited but they are not pre-generated
    -> but they are generated just-in-time when a request reaches a server, and that allows us to pre-generate
    ->highly visited pages and postpone the generation to less frequently visited pages to the server  

14. If the user directly enters the dynamic route in search bar. 
    -> nextjs will throw an error. because data is not present at front-end and nextjs 
    -> will need some time to fetch it. so we need to create a fallback block like a spinner or loader
    -> till nextjs fetches the data and after getting the data nextjs will automatically update the component
    -> with fetched data. 
    -> If we set fallback: "blocking", we can remove that fallback block from the component but
    -> it will take nextjs a little bit longer to load the page.

15. server side rendering 
    -> sometimes you need to pre-render for every request OR you need access to the request object(e.g. for cookies)
    -> nextjs allows you to run "real server side code" as well
    -> which means it gives you a function which you can add in you page component files
    -> which is then executed whenever the request for this page reaches the server 
    -> so it is not pre-generated during build time or every couple of seconds
    -> but it's really a server side code which is executed every time request reaches the server
    -> and that function is "async function getServerSideProps()"
    -> for a single page component we can either use "getStaticProps" or "getServerSideProps"


16. client-side data fetching
    -> some data doesn't need to be pre-rendered. like
    -> data changing with high frequency(e.g. stock data)
    -> highly user-specific data(e.g. last orders in an online shop)
    -> (because search engine won't see this data, it needs auth)
    -> partial data (e.g. data that's only used on a part of a page)
    -> (let's say you have dashboard page with lots of different pieces of data, lots of different kinds of data. 
    -> In such case, loading all these different pieces which makes the overall dashboard might slow down the request if you do that on the server).

17. "useSWR"(stale-while-revalidate) nextjs hook to fetch data. under the hood it still uses fetch API. 
    -> but it has other feture like caching data and revalidating data and on focus re-fetch the data
    -> SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), 
    -> then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.
    -> https://swr.vercel.app/

18. combining pre-fetching with client-side fetching
    -> using useEffect on client side and getStaticProps from server side

19. To inject head content of HTML page.
    -> we can use <Head> component from "next/head"
    -> add it to any component and it will be added to head html tag of the page.

20. _app.js is root app component
    -> _app.js is a application shell
    -> _app.js is a root component inside the body of the HTML page.
    -> which is rendered for every page that has been displayed.
    -> nextjs merges if have multiple <Head> tags
    -> if we have duplicates in <Head> tag then later one wins

21. _document.js allows us to customize the entire HTML document
    -> default document structure:
    -> <Html>
            <Head />
            <body>
                <Main />
                <NextScript />
            </body>
        </Html>
    -> what could be the reason to override that default document?
    -> if you want to configure the general document like adding the lang="en" attribute to Html tag.
    
22. <Image> component
    -> if we use this component nextjs will create multiple versions of our image on the fly when requests are coming in.
    -> optimize for the OS and device sizes that are making the requests.
    -> then those generated images will be cached for future requests from similar devices.
    -> for ex- chrome supports webp images which are more compressed.
    -> images lazy loaded by <Image> component, so when it comes on viewport, A request will be made.
    
23. API routes
    -> create rest API's under /pages/api
    -> fileName = rest endpoint 
    -> export a function which takes req, res as arguments
